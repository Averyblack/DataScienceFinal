# DataScienceFinal

My attempt to solve the final task form Data Science and Machine Learning on SkillShare.
The aim was to engage several machine learning models to predict if Mammographic Masses are benign or malignant.
Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes models were used.
Highest accuracy of prediciton was established with SVM(80%) followed by KNN(79%).
